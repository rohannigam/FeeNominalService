  /* Important Notes on Implementation
  - We want to use API Access key instead of JWT token for the FeeNominalService (Done)
  - We want to swtich to using AWS Secret Manager to store the API Access Key  
  - We want to use the AWS SDK to get the API Access Key from the Secret Manager so research needed on how to do this
  - We want to make sure connection between DataCenter (GR2) for MerchantPortal->FeeNominalService->Interpayments is secure
  - We want to make sure connection between DataCenter (GR2) for XiPayWSServers->FeeNominalService->Interpayments is secure
  - We can ensure the first half this by making sure the API Access Key is not exposed and is accessed via VPC endpoints

  TODO:
  5/17/2025
  - Service provider tables Implementation (Done)
  - API Key Rotation Process
  - Error Handling in API Responses.
  - Merchant validation endpoints
  - Onboarding flow documentation.
  - Network timeouts to providers.
  - Make changes to code base to reflect all init.sql changes to 'id' fields. (Done)

  - Changes to Merchant addition:
    ok let me tell you a little about what i am thinking. So as i mentioned before, there is going to be  an on prem onboarding portal 
    that will register its own merchant to our FeeNominalService using onboarding endpoints. In the externalId we are going to pass 
    the merchantId field from that onboarding portal. Then there would be a generate button that will call 
    onboarding/initialApiKeyGenerate endpoint where in we should be just passin in externalId and a merchant Name and possibly a 
    unique merchantGUID that onboarding portal has tied to that externalId in its DB and then I think we should return a unique
    merchantGuid from FeeNominalService along with unique ApiKey and a secret to go with it along with other existing fields we 
    added support for already. 
  */

  /*With respect to supporting mulitple API Keys per single Merchant
  Based on your requirements, here's my opinion on implementing multiple API keys per merchant:

1. **Database Schema Changes Needed:**
```sql
-- Merchant table to store merchant information
CREATE TABLE merchants (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    merchant_id VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,  -- External merchant ID from on-prem systems
    name VARCHAR(255),
    status VARCHAR(20),
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- API Keys table to store multiple keys per merchant
CREATE TABLE api_keys (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    merchant_id UUID REFERENCES merchants(id),
    key VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    secret VARCHAR(255),
    description VARCHAR(255),
    rate_limit INTEGER,
    allowed_endpoints TEXT[],
    status VARCHAR(20),  -- ACTIVE, REVOKED, EXPIRED
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    last_rotated_at TIMESTAMP,
    revoked_at TIMESTAMP,
    created_by VARCHAR(50),  -- Which on-prem service created this key
    external_reference_id VARCHAR(255)  -- Reference ID from on-prem system
);

-- API Key Usage table for audit and rate limiting
CREATE TABLE api_key_usage (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    api_key_id UUID REFERENCES api_keys(id),
    endpoint VARCHAR(255),
    request_count INTEGER,
    last_used_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

2. **Key Management Strategy:**
- Each API key should have a unique identifier within the merchant's scope
- Keys can be tagged with their purpose (e.g., "Surcharge Calculation", "Refund Processing")
- Keys can have different rate limits and endpoint permissions
- Keys can be created by different on-prem services

3. **API Key Generation Flow:**
```
On-Prem Service -> This Service
1. On-prem service calls with:
   - External merchant ID
   - Key purpose/description
   - Required permissions
   - External reference ID
2. This service:
   - Maps external merchant ID to internal merchant
   - Generates new API key
   - Stores with reference to on-prem system
   - Returns key details
```

4. **Authentication Flow:**
```
On-Prem Service -> This Service
1. On-prem service includes:
   - API Key
   - Merchant ID
   - Signature
2. This service:
   - Validates merchant exists
   - Finds API key for merchant
   - Validates key is active
   - Checks rate limits
   - Validates signature
```

5. **Key Features to Consider:**
- Key expiration dates
- Key rotation policies
- Usage tracking per key
- Different rate limits per key
- Different endpoint permissions per key
- Audit logging of key usage
- Key status tracking

6. **Security Considerations:**
- Each key should have its own secret
- Keys should be stored securely (AWS Secrets Manager)
- Keys should be rotated periodically
- Keys should be revocable individually
- Keys should have usage monitoring

7. **Integration Points:**
- On-prem onboarding portal
- SOAP web services
- Internal service authentication
- External service authentication

8. **Monitoring and Management:**
- Track key usage per merchant
- Monitor rate limit compliance
- Track key creation and revocation
- Audit key usage patterns
- Alert on suspicious activity

9. **Key States:**
- ACTIVE: Key is valid and can be used
- REVOKED: Key has been manually revoked
- EXPIRED: Key has reached its expiration date
- ROTATED: Key has been rotated (old version)

10. **Rate Limiting Strategy:**
- Per-key rate limits
- Per-merchant rate limits
- Per-endpoint rate limits
- Burst capacity handling

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or discuss specific implementation details?

************************************************************************
7/14/2025 - Weekly Summary
************************************************************************

## **Summary of Changes in Last 6 Hours - 7/14/2025**

### **1. Surcharge Provider Update Validation Fix**
**Problem:** Update requests were failing with `SURCH_2005 - Credentials schema is required` even when credentials schema was provided.

**Root Cause:** The `ValidateCredentialsSchema` method in the base class always required a schema, and the derived class was hiding (not overriding) the property/method, causing validation to always fail.

**Solution:**
- Made the base method `virtual` and the derived method `override`
- Removed the `new` property from the derived class to avoid property hiding and model binding issues
- Added debug logging to trace the validation flow

### **2. Surcharge Provider Delete Status Fix**
**Problem:** When deleting a surcharge provider, the response showed "ACTIVE" status instead of "DELETED".

**Root Cause:** The entity might not be properly reloaded from the database after the soft delete operation, or there might be a caching issue.

**Solution:**
- Added debug logging to track the status changes
- Added verification to ensure the status is correctly set to "DELETED"
- Added explicit reloading of the entity after the soft delete operation

### **3. EF Core Transaction Error Fix**
**Problem:** Runtime error about user-initiated transactions and retrying execution strategies.

**Solution:** Wrapped manual transaction logic in the execution strategy for Npgsql.

### **4. is_primary Logic and Documentation**
**Added/clarified logic** to ensure only one surcharge provider configuration per (merchant, provider) pair can be primary.
**Added WARN logging** when a new config is set as primary and another is demoted.
**Updated documentation** to reflect the new `isPrimary` field and single-primary enforcement.

## **7/14/2025 - Additional Changes: GET Surcharge Providers with Deleted Support**

### **New Feature: Optional Deleted Provider Inclusion**
**Problem:** No way to view deleted providers for audit or administrative purposes.

**Solution:** Added optional `includeDeleted` query parameter to GET surcharge providers endpoint.

**Implementation:**
- **Service Layer:** Added overload method `GetByMerchantIdAsync(string merchantId, bool includeDeleted)`
- **Controller:** Updated `GetAllProviders` to accept optional `includeDeleted` query parameter (default: false)
- **Repository:** Leveraged existing `GetByMerchantIdAsync(string merchantId, bool includeDeleted)` method
- **Documentation:** Updated API docs with examples and usage notes

### **Files Updated:**

#### **Services/**
1. **Services/ISurchargeProviderService.cs**
   - Added new method signature: `GetByMerchantIdAsync(string merchantId, bool includeDeleted)`

2. **Services/SurchargeProviderService.cs**
   - Added implementation of the new overload method with proper logging

#### **Controllers/**
3. **Controllers/V1/SurchargeProviderController.cs**
   - Updated `GetAllProviders` method to accept optional `includeDeleted` query parameter (default: false)
   - Added proper logging for the new parameter
   - Updated method documentation

#### **Documentation/**
4. **Docs/Endpoints/SurchargeProviderEndpoints.txt**
   - Added query parameter documentation for `includeDeleted`
   - Updated example requests to show both default and includeDeleted=true scenarios
   - Added notes about the functionality and use cases

### **API Usage Examples:**

```bash
# Get only active and inactive providers (default behavior)
GET /api/v1/merchants/{merchantId}/surcharge-providers

# Include deleted providers for audit purposes
GET /api/v1/merchants/{merchantId}/surcharge-providers?includeDeleted=true
```

### **Key Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **Backward Compatible:** Existing clients continue to work without changes
- ‚úÖ **Optional Parameter:** Defaults to `false` to maintain current behavior
- ‚úÖ **Audit Support:** Enables viewing deleted providers for administrative purposes
- ‚úÖ **Admin Interface:** Supports full provider history visibility
- ‚úÖ **Recovery Scenarios:** Helps identify deleted providers for potential restoration

### **Use Cases:**
1. **Audit Purposes:** View all providers including deleted ones
2. **Admin Interfaces:** Full visibility of provider history
3. **Recovery Scenarios:** Identify deleted providers for potential restoration
4. **Compliance:** Track provider lifecycle for regulatory requirements

The implementation leverages existing repository infrastructure and provides a clean, minimal addition that enhances administrative capabilities without breaking existing functionality.

## **KEY VALIDATION PATTERNS IDENTIFIED**

### **1. Authentication Layer (ApiKeyAuthHandler)**
**Previous Approach:**
- **Header Validation**: Required `X-Merchant-ID`, `X-API-Key`, `X-Timestamp`, `X-Nonce`, `X-Signature`
- **Signature Validation**: HMAC-SHA256 signature verification
- **Timestamp Validation**: 5-minute tolerance window
- **Claims Generation**: `MerchantId`, `ApiKey`, `AllowedEndpoints`
- **Rate Limiting**: Per API key with configurable limits
- **Issues**: 
  - No scope claims
  - No admin scope support
  - Merchant-centric by design

### **2. Authorization Layer (Program.cs Policies)**
**Previous Approach:**
- **InitialKeyGeneration Policy**: Only timestamp/nonce validation
- **ApiKeyAccess Policy**: Required `MerchantId` claim + endpoint validation
- **Endpoint Validation**: Wildcard matching with `EndpointMatcher`
- **Issues**: 
  - No scope-based authorization
  - No admin scope support
  - Merchant-centric policies

### **3. Business Logic Validation**
**Previous Approach:**
- **Merchant Validation**: Always required merchant ID
- **API Key Validation**: Status, expiration, rate limits
- **Provider Validation**: Merchant-scoped provider operations
- **Transaction Validation**: Merchant-scoped transaction processing
- **Issues**: 
  - No admin scope support
  - No cross-merchant operations
  - Hardcoded merchant-centric logic

## **CRITICAL ISSUES WITH PRE-SCOPING VALIDATION**

### **1. Schema Limitations**
- **Merchant-Centric Design**: All tables required `merchant_id` (non-nullable)
- **No Scope Separation**: No way to distinguish admin vs merchant operations
- **Hardcoded Dependencies**: Business logic assumed merchant context

### **2. Authentication Gaps**
- **No Scope Claims**: Authentication didn't include scope information
- **Admin Secret Bypass**: Admin operations used separate authentication mechanism
- **Mixed Logic**: Admin and merchant operations mixed in same endpoints

### **3. Authorization Weaknesses**
- **No Scope-Based Policies**: Authorization policies didn't consider scope
- **Hardcoded Admin Checks**: Admin validation hardcoded in endpoints
- **No Flexible Permissions**: No granular permission system

### **4. Business Logic Issues**
- **Merchant Assumptions**: All operations assumed merchant context
- **No Cross-Merchant Support**: No way to perform operations across merchants
- **Provider Config Limitations**: Provider configs tied to specific merchants

### **5. Security Concerns**
- **Inconsistent Validation**: Different validation approaches for admin vs merchant
- **Scope Confusion**: No clear separation between admin and merchant operations
- **Audit Trail Gaps**: Audit trails didn't distinguish admin vs merchant operations

## **RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POST-SCOPING IMPROVEMENTS**

### **1. Unified Authentication**
- **Scope Claims**: Include `Scope` and `IsAdmin` claims in authentication
- **Consistent Validation**: Use same authentication mechanism for all operations
- **Flexible Permissions**: Support both admin and merchant scopes

### **2. Enhanced Authorization**
- **Scope-Based Policies**: Create policies that consider scope
- **Granular Permissions**: Support different permission levels
- **Cross-Merchant Support**: Allow admin operations across merchants

### **3. Improved Business Logic**
- **Scope-Aware Operations**: Business logic should consider scope
- **Flexible Provider Configs**: Support admin-scoped provider configurations
- **Enhanced Audit Trails**: Distinguish between admin and merchant operations

### **4. Better Security**
- **Consistent Validation**: Apply same validation standards to all operations
- **Clear Scope Separation**: Maintain clear boundaries between admin and merchant operations
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Track scope-based usage patterns

This analysis reveals that the pre-scoping validation was fundamentally merchant-centric with ad-hoc admin support, leading to inconsistent validation patterns and security concerns. The new scope-based system addresses these issues by providing a unified, flexible, and secure approach to validation across all operations.

```json
"AWS": {
  "SecretsManager": {
    "MerchantSecretNameFormat": "feenominal/merchants/{merchantId}/apikeys/{apiKey}",
    "AdminSecretNameFormat": "feenominal/admin/apikeys/{serviceName}-admin-api-key-secret"
  }
}
```

### **Admin Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/v1/admin/apiKey/generate` - Generate admin API key
- `POST /api/v1/admin/apikey/rotate` - Rotate admin API key
- `POST /api/v1/admin/apikey/revoke` - Revoke admin API key

## **ÔøΩÔøΩ Key Benefits Achieved**

### **1. Admin Key Management**
‚úÖ **Global Access**: Admin keys can access any merchant data  
‚úÖ **Multi-Service Support**: Different admin keys per service  
‚úÖ **Secure Validation**: Admin secret required for key generation  
‚úÖ **Cross-Platform Scripts**: Easy deployment to AWS Secrets Manager  

### **2. Configurable Secret Patterns**
‚úÖ **Flexible Naming**: Both patterns configurable via appsettings  
‚úÖ **Consistent Usage**: All services use centralized formatter  
‚úÖ **Backward Compatible**: Existing patterns work as defaults  
‚úÖ **Environment Specific**: Different patterns per environment

************************************************************************
7/19/2025 -  Complete Summary: Sale and Bulk Sale updates
************************************************************************
Certainly! Here‚Äôs a concise summary of the major work and improvements made over the last 1‚Äì2 days around the sale and bulk sale requests:

---

### 1. **Refactored Sale and Bulk Sale Endpoints**
- **Single Sale (`/api/v1/surcharge/sale`):**
  - Made `surchargeTransactionId` optional. If provided, all other fields (provider info, correlationId, etc.) become optional and are looked up from the database.
  - If `surchargeTransactionId` is not provided, the request must include `providerTransactionId`, `providerCode`, `providerType`, and `correlationId`.
  - The response now includes:
    - `surchargeTransactionId` (from request or looked up)
    - `originalSurchargeTransactionId` (root of the auth chain)
    - `currentSurchargeTransactionId` (newly created sale transaction)
    - `surchargeFee` and `surchargeFeePercent` (extracted from the referenced transaction)
    - All other relevant transaction and provider fields

- **Bulk Sale (`/api/v1/surcharge/bulk-sale-complete`):**
  - Supports true admin/cross-merchant batch operations.
  - Each sale item can use either `surchargeTransactionId` or direct provider info.
  - Batch ID is always system-generated and unique.
  - Supports partial success: each sale result is reported individually with status and error message if any.
  - Per-sale response includes all the same fields as the single sale endpoint, including correct fee reporting.

---

### 2. **Fee Extraction and Data Integrity**
- Fixed logic to ensure `surchargeFee` and `surchargeFeePercent` are always extracted from the correct transaction (using the incoming `surchargeTransactionId`).
- Ensured that the response always reports the correct transaction IDs for traceability (`surchargeTransactionId`, `originalSurchargeTransactionId`, `currentSurchargeTransactionId`).

---

### 3. **Robust Error Handling and Null Safety**
- Addressed and fixed all null dereference warnings and linter errors.
- Added explicit null checks and improved variable scoping for clarity and safety.

---

### 4. **Documentation and Examples**
- Updated the `.http` file and created new endpoint documentation (`SurchargeSaleAndBulkSaleEnpoints.txt`) with:
  - Up-to-date request/response models
  - Example requests and responses
  - ASCII workflow diagrams
  - Special notes on admin/cross-merchant support, batch ID generation, and error handling

---

### 5. **Admin/Batch Support and Security**
- Clarified and enforced that bulk sale endpoints require admin-scope API keys.
- Documented the authentication and security requirements for all endpoints.

---

**In summary:**  
The sale and bulk sale flows are now more flexible, robust, and well-documented. They support both merchant and admin use cases, provide detailed per-transaction results, and ensure data integrity and traceability throughout the workflow.
